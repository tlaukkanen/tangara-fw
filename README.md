# Tangara

Tangara is an open-hardware portable music player. It runs on an ESP32, fits in
your pocket, and has a battery that lasts all day.

## Source Repositories

[tangara-fw](https://git.sr.ht/~jacqueline/tangara-fw): The ESP32 firmware,
comprising the bulk of Tangara's functionality. This is probably the repo
that you're most interested in!

[tangara-hw](https://git.sr.ht/~jacqueline/tangara-hw): Sources for the entire
physical device. Includes both the case/enclosure, and the PCBs.

[tangara-samd-fw](https://git.sr.ht/~jacqueline/tangara-samd-fw): Firmware for
the SAMD21 co-processor that manages USB connectivity, charging, and power
management of the ESP32.
